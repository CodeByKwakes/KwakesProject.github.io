                With a background of creativity courtesy of a Music Technology degree and after working in the customer service industry for many years, I decided that I was ready for a new and exciting challenge and change career paths completely. I've always had an interest in all things tech, web and software driven so I decided to learn the fundamentals of programming full-stack websites and apps. 
                <br>
                <br>    
                Iâ€™m very enthusiastic and excited to find a Junior Developer role to help harness and unlock my creativity and grow my passion for new technologies. I am very keen to utilise my current skills and develop new ones, with a desire to work within an organisation that will offer training and career progression. 
                <br>
                Music, sports and movies are my main loves in life. I play football every Saturday afternoon for a local club and a loyal Arsenal fan. I also love every opportunity to get myself on a dance floor and showoff my moves. I sometimes DJ parties and events whenever the opportunity comes and also produce music tracks in my spare time. Twelve years in a cinema will show you that I could watch and talk about movies all day and I try to get up to date with the latest releases and upcoming movies. </p>
